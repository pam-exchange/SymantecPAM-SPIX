# SymantecPAM SPIX

Many years ago a tool named **xsie** used for exporting and importing information to the Credential Management part of Xceedium (now Symantec PAM) was available as a Perl script. 

The tool SPIX is now available as a PowerShell script. It has a similar functionality as the original xsie tool.

SPIX uses the CLI and API for finding and updating information in the credential management part of Symantec PAM. It uses a login user for CLI commands and an API key for API calls. 

There are two Powershell scripts available.
